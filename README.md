# Claude Coder Agents: Multi-Task AI Agents for Code & UX

![Robot](https://img.icons8.com/fluency/96/000000/robot.png) Claude Coder Agents brings together specialized AI agents to handle a wide range of tasks. This project focuses on practical, resilient, and extensible AI helpers that can work together to automate coding, content generation, design tasks, localization, and more. The goal is not to replace humans but to amplify capabilities across development, design, and localization workflows.

This repository hosts a framework for building, orchestrating, and deploying multiple AI agents. Each agent specializes in a domain, and the system coordinates their work to deliver coherent results. The architecture emphasizes clarity, safety, and observability, with an emphasis on prompt engineering, interaction patterns, and robust integration points.

Why this project
- Enable teams to automate repetitive tasks
- Provide specialized assistants for code, copywriting, design, and localization
- Improve consistency across tasks by using a shared prompt framework
- Allow teams to compose complex workflows with minimal boilerplate
- Promote rapid experimentation and safe iteration of AI-assisted work

Core concepts and design goals
- Modularity: Each agent has a focused domain and a clear interface.
- Coordination: A central orchestrator handles task distribution, state, retries, and conflict resolution.
- Prompt-centric design: Prompts, templates, and decision logic drive agent behavior; there is a library of proven templates for common tasks.
- Observability: Every task has logs, traces, and metrics so you can inspect decisions and outcomes.
- Safety: Guardrails and policy enforcement to minimize risky outputs and leaks.
- Localization: Built-in support for multiple languages and cultural norms.
- UX-first: The system is designed to be intuitive for developers, designers, and non-technical owners.

Agent catalog
- CodeAgent: Writes, analyzes, and refactors code. Handles languages like Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and shell scripts. Can generate unit tests and documentation.
- CopyAgent: Produces marketing copy, product descriptions, and technical documentation with tone control and style guides.
- DesignAgent: Assists with UX wireframes, UI copy, and interaction design, offering design rationale and collaboration with design tools.
- LocalizationAgent: Translates and localizes content, ensuring region-specific phrasing, date formats, and currency handling.
- TestAgent: Creates and runs test plans, test cases, and coverage analyses; flags flaky tests and suggests fixes.
- DeployAgent: Helps with deployment scripts, infrastructure as code, and release automation for cloud and on-prem environments.
- DataAgent: Extracts, cleans, and analyzes data; creates dashboards and reports.
- ResearchAgent: Gathers information, summarizes findings, and keeps knowledge bases up to date.
- ConversationAgent: Manages chat and dialogue flows for chatbots and assistants, including intent and entity extraction.
- PromptingAgent: Maintains and evolves the prompt templates and policy rules used by other agents.
- ComplianceAgent: Checks outputs against policy, business rules, and regulatory requirements.

Architecture and patterns
- Orchestrator pattern: A central coordinator delegates tasks to specialized agents, monitors progress, and handles retries.
- Agent lifecycle: Initialization, task assignment, execution, result integration, and cleanup.
- Prompt library: A structured repository of templates, instructions, and example interactions.
- State machine: Each task passes through defined states (pending, active, done, failed) with clear transitions.
- Event-driven: Components publish and subscribe to events for loose coupling and responsiveness.
- Observability: Traces, metrics, and logs are available for each task and agent.

Getting started
- This project is designed to be approachable for developers with a wide range of backgrounds. The first steps involve setting up your environment, installing dependencies, and starting a small multi-agent workflow to validate the end-to-end flow.

  - The release asset includes a ready-to-run configuration and a sample workflow to prove the end-to-end experience
- Quick verification
  - Start the orchestrator
  - Confirm that a simple task, such as generating a code snippet or a short document, completes successfully
  - Check logs for the task state and agent decisions
- Troubleshooting
  - If an agent fails, inspect the event stream to determine which step caused the failure
  - Verify API keys, rate limits, and network access
  - Review the prompts and templates used by the failing agent and adjust if needed

Quick start: a minimal example
- The following outline shows how to boot a small workflow that uses two agents: CodeAgent and CopyAgent
- Pseudocode (illustrative)
  - Open a task: "Create a starter web page with a responsive layout and accessibility features."
  - CodeAgent generates a clean, accessible HTML/CSS scaffold
  - CopyAgent writes a short description and README text for the scaffold
  - The orchestrator coordinates the flow, merges the results, and presents a final artifact
- Example usage
  - Initialize the hub: hub = AgentHub(config)
  - Create a task: task = Task(type="web-page", goal="Generate a starter HTML page with a responsive layout and accessible markup.")
  - Run: hub.run(task)
  - Retrieve results: results = hub.get_results(task_id)
- Expected outcomes
  - A clean HTML scaffold with semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and a responsive CSS grid
  - A short README describing the scaffold and how to extend it
- Notes
  - This minimal example demonstrates how agents work together
  - Real projects will require more elaborate templates, policy checks, and integration steps
